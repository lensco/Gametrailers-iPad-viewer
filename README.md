## ¿Que?

I like watching some game trailers on the iPad at lunch, but the gametrailers.com website rather sucks. So I hacked this thing together: some very dirty PHP/JS/HTML that scrapes GT and only shows the good/relevant parts, with direct links to the HD videos.

Should work on all browsers, but made for the iPad. Save it to your homescreen and you have your own GT web app. Yay!

Did I mention it's dirty?

## Issues

- Some videos are only available in flash format, and therefore left out on these pages. That's why not every page has 15 videos.
- No links to the original GT pages – might be useful to see comments, ratings, …
